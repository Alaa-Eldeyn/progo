الحاجة اللي عجبتنا واجدة هي كيف هم يتواصلوا معنا باستمرار ويردوا على كل استفساراتنا بسرعة وفعالية. الخدمة ما كانت بس مجرد تنفيذ المشروع، لكن حتى بعد ما خلصنا هم متواجدين لأي دعم نحتاجه.
بالمختصر، اللي ديروه شركة PROGO كان فوق توقعاتنا، وإن شاء الله يكون بيننا تعاون مستمر في المستقبل. بارك الله فيكم على الخدمة الرائعة والمهنية العالية.`,

    review: `أحب أشكر شركة PROGO على مشروع "سوق الجامعة" اللي سووه لنا. المشروع كان عبارة عن متجر إلكتروني مشابه للسوق المفتوح، ومعاه داشبورد وتطبيق. الخدمة بصراحة كانت ممتازة والفريق كان متعاون ومحترف جدًا.
من بداية المشروع، كانوا يسمعون لمتطلباتنا ويفهمون وش نحتاج بالضبط. التصميم كان رهيب والتطبيق سهل الاستخدام. الشي اللي حمسنا أكثر هو الدعم المستمر من الفريق حتى بعد تسليم المشروع.
شغلهم كان على مستوى عالي من الجودة والإتقان، وأكيد بنستمر نتعامل معهم في مشاريعنا القادمة. الله يعطيهم العافية وما قصّروا.`,
