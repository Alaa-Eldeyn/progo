    question: "What is the cost of software development?",
    answer:
      "The costs of developing medium to large-scale software applications typically range from $2,000 to $15,000 USD. The total cost primarily depends on the number of software features and their complexity, the number of supported core systems (web, mobile, desktop), and the type of development (custom development, low-code development, platform-based development). Additionally, the uniqueness and complexity of user interface design, the number of software integration processes, as well as requirements for availability, security, and performance, also play a significant role in determining the development cost. You can request a project cost estimate for free from Progo or learn more details about software development costs in our recently published guide.",
